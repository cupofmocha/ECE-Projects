Question 1:
From my results, it appears that as the number of rolling increases from 10 to 1,000 then to
100,000 , the chance of each of the six faces of the single die appearing becomes more and 
more equal. This phenomenon makes sense because as you increase the number of 
experiments/rolling, more data would be gathered and the average of them would indicate that
each face has roughly 1/6 of the chance being rolled.

Question 2:
My result indicates that there is only about 8% chance that there is exactly an even split
between the occurence of low and high values, after performing 10,000 experiments.
Let's say for 1 experiment, there could be two possibilites, low value or high value, then
since we are expecting 50 of them are low and the other 50 are high, we are essentially
choosing 50 from 100 (100 C 50). Then the total possibilites are 2^100 for 100 rolls
due to two possible values: high or low, thus
the chance of getting equal amounts of high value and low value is: (100 C 50) / 2^100,
which is approximately 8%.

Question 3:
From my results, it can be observed that the chance of each sum occuring, from 2 to 12,
are approximately: 3%, 6%, 8%, 11%, 14%, 17%, 14%, 11%, 8%, 6%, 3%. This is as expected
because say for sum to be 2, there is only 1 possibility 1+1, so its chance of occuring is
merely 1/36 = 3%. However, take sum = 7 for example, this has the highest chance of occuring
because there are 6 possibilities in which it could occur: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
Due to this nature, the distribution is expected to be:
Total on dice	Pairs of dice	              Probability
    2	        1+1	                      1/36 = 3%
    3	        1+2, 2+1	              2/36 = 6%
    4	        1+3, 2+2, 3+1	              3/36 = 8%
    5	        1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1	      4/36 = 11%
    6	        1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1	      5/36 = 14%
    7	        1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6/36 = 17%
    8	        2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2	      5/36 = 14%
    9	        3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3	      4/36 = 11%
   10	        4+6, 5+5, 6+4	              3/36 = 8%
   11	        5+6, 6+5	              2/36 = 6%
   12	        6+6	                      1/36 = 3%

Question 4:
From my results, I would pick the threshold 18 for stand. The reasoning is because it is
pretty close to the blackjack value of 21, with a relatively low busting probability (¡Ö40%).
I would not want to consider thresholds 19 or above since their busting probability are all
greater than 50%, which means that you are more likely to bust than to be safe.

Question 5:
From my result, it apppears that the hi-lo card counting algorithm yielded approximately
23% to 24% chance of betting right. Although this is not an impressive result, it could be
used as an indication to decide how much you should wager for the next hand. 
For example, if you have lost 3 bets, then the next one you are likely to bet it correctly,
so you might want to wager higher for the next hand. Conversely, if you have won a bet, 
then you would expect the next few hands are not favoured to you, 
so you should reserve your wager.
