# Boolean SAT Solver

<h2> Purpose: </h2>

<p>
  This is a C program that determines whether or not a given Boolean function is satisfiable.
</p>

<h2> How it works </h2>

<p>
  This program takes in a Boolean function which consists of tuples of literals and logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT) in a 2D array structure, and goes through them one by one to determine its truth value (each literal has predefined truth value). Once this is done, the program will determine if the given Boolean function is satisfiable, and further if it is a tautology.
