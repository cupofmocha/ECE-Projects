This is a Discord Tournament Bot that I made with Python 3 and integrated with MongoDB. It is hosted on Repl.it and monitored via UptimeRobot.\
As its name implies, its goal is to simulate a real tournament event where it can manage participants, track their scores, and calculate who advances to the next round based on their scores. It is designed for the very-popular 3D mobile game called Arcaea.\
Currently an Arcaea tourney has 4 stages: Qualifiers round (n players), Quarter-Finals (8 players), Semi-Finals (4 players), and Finals (2 players).
